            <h3>If you plan on borrowing money, whether a fixed loan or a revolving loan(credit cards) here are somethings to know.</h3>
            <h4>Every time a Creditor runs your Credit, it counts as a hard inquiry and hard inquiries go on your record and will lower your score,
                they will disappear on their own after 2 full years.</h4>
            <br />
            <h3>Credit Cards</h3>
            <p>Revolving Lines of Credit, such as credit cards and lines of credit, allow  you to spend more than once and only pay interest on what you spend.</p>
            <h4>The most important thing to know here is that Credit Bereaus only see your credit once per month, when your creditors report it.
                So there is a strategy to maximize your credit impact.</h4>
            <p>The strategy for building credit is to figure out the due date and plan payments around it.</p><br /> <p>Your due date is:
                the {dueDate} of this month, <b>{month}</b>, so this month you will pay the bill</p>
            <p>{month % 2 === 0 ? <b>Before the {dueDate}</b> : <b>After the {dueDate}, when the bill arrives!</b>}</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Loans</h3>
            <p>Fixed Loans you receive a fixed amount once and pay it back over a certain time period</p>
            <h4>The most important thing happens when you pay it off!</h4>
            <p>When the loan is fully paid off, it disappears from your credit history for about 3 months while the history of the loan is analyzed.
                After, the loan will appear on your credit history as a closed loan and it will prove that you paid off a loan in it's entirity.</p>
